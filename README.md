# BS-Lightshow-mod

Game/Mod half of the project [BS-Lightshow](https://github.com/Jangberry/BS-Lightshow)

## How to install

1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed:
    - BSIPA
    - [CustomJSONData](https://github.com/Aeroluna/CustomJSONData)
2. Download the [release](https://github.com/Jangberry/BS-Lightshow-mod/releases/latest)
3. Extract the zip file your BeatSaber directory
3. Follow the steps to put in place your leds on [this repository](https://github.com/Jangberry/BS-Lightshow)

## Configuration

In your BeatSaber directory, under Userdata you will find `BS-Lightshow-mod.json`, with this you may configure the parameters related to the server (as of v0.0.1 it requires a TLS enabled server) and how often you want to ping your lighting device (used to compensate the delay)

## Inspiration

While the RGB strip idea came alone, I have to admit that stubling on [CUESaber](https://github.com/Zeitheron/CUESaber) really decided me to begin the mod and helped me a bit into understanding modding.
I don't handle it the same way as it does tho, mainly because of the delay but also because my interaction with LEDs is different.
